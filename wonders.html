        <h1>Magic, Mervellies, And All That Jazz</h1>

<p>A host of wonders and marvels shelter on stainless steel slates that are either floating or affixed to the wall, and you can't really tell which. They are vertically arranged in a manner reminiscent of shelves, looking down upon their envious cousins, standing gaudily on the podiums next to the "shelf". </p>

<h1><em>Lamentations of Osiris, Section IV</em></h1>

<p><em>The true wonder blushes in shyness.</em></p>

<p><em>They consider the very idea of being exposed and paraded around as being akin to our idea of death, as a sort of inevitable occurence that consumes all the life and magic that the marvel once brought, yet it's inevitability merely adds to the item's wonder until that very mystical quality is beaten to death by the fame bestowed upon it.</em></p>

<p>The bloody battle for your attention that all these objects waged on the millisecond they entered your perception was fierce, yet from their perspective, the intrusion of your consiousness was more comparable to the average Arch Linux forum being disrupted by the arrival of an arch-etypical uninitiated new user: Another bloody battle, albiet with a differing dynamic.</p>
