        <h1>The Gates</h1>

<p>Navigating through the abyssopelagic
refuse washed onto the rocks, you get
close enough to the enigmatic
structure that you begin to notice a
soft, ethereal humming noise flowing
through the air, produced by a smooth,
minty-green panel attached to a
massive, vault-like entryway.  </p>

<p>On the panel's screen, a large symbol
resembling a human hand flashes in a
trance-inducing pattern, calling you forward
to <a href="./entering.html">interact</a> with it.</p>
