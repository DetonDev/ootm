        <h1>Waiting Room</h1>

<p>The hall gives way to an expansive room, decorated with an ample supply of <a href="./wonders.html">wunderkammern</a> to hold the attention of visitors that would otherwise tire of sitting on the plain, sparse furnishings clinging to both sides of the heavy metal door that sits still until the visitors are cleared for a visit.</p>
