<h1>Entry Hall</h1>

<p>You make your way inside and are greeted to what, on first glance, looks like a sterile metal hallway ripped from a certain sci-fi movie of questionable artistic merit. Nothing here draws your eye, and the painfully bright rod-shaped lights on the ceiling even seem to discourage examining your surroundings too closely.</p>
